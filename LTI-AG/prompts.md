## Human-in-the-Loop Approach ü§ù

Talento Express employs a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach to ensure AI-augmented decision-making without removing human judgment:

1. **Initial AI Processing:** Automated screening and ranking of candidates
2. **Human Review & Adjustment:** Recruiters review AI recommendations and make adjustments
3. **Feedback Loop:** System learns from human decisions to improve future recommendations
4. **Collaborative Decision Points:** Key hiring decisions require multi-stakeholder human input
5. **Transparency Controls:** All AI-driven suggestions include explainability features
6. **Override Capabilities:** Human users can override automated decisions with justification
7. **Continuous Learning:** System refines algorithms based on hiring outcomes and success metrics
