1) I am a senior product manager.

I am trying to convince my stake holders to finance my new startup project, which is called LTI.

The product is ATS (Applicant-Tracking System), and consists in an application that helps hiring managers and company job candidates to: HR creates job descriptions and publish them in social media, candidates can apply to the offers, offers are received, offers are reviewed by HR people, the interested candidate make some capacity tests in the same platform, and if passed, a meeting can be scheduled and the selected candidate is hired.

Please, I am going to ask you a few things:

    1) give me a brief description of the desired software, its added value, and competitive advantages. Explanation of key features. Add a Lean Canvas diagram to understand the business model.
    2) Describe the 3 main use cases, with the diagram associated with each one
    3) Data model covering entities, attributes (name and type), and relationships
    4) High-level system design, both explained and with an attached diagram
    5) C4 diagram that goes in-depth into one of the system components, whichever you prefer

2) after finishing with the use cases, ChatGPT asked me if everything was fine so far so it can move on with the next steps, and I replied that everything was ok
3) ChatGPT got stuck and wasn't providing the next steps, so I had to ask it again
4) I was able to receive the diagrams, and I was asked if everything was fine so the data model can be created
5) asked again if everything was fine so the system design and C4 diagram can be created, and I indicated that I wanted to zoom in in the containers
6) ChatGPT only provided the containers component, so I had to ask for the rest of the components
7) i had to move to DiagramGPT since ChatGPT web version informed that I had reached my daily limit of requests for GPT-4o, and I wasn't able to create the rest of the components
8) i was asked some questions on the required app aspects ![img.png](pictures/img.png)
9) since DiagramGPT doesn't provide the C4 diagram, I had to move to Cursor integrated ChatGPT GPT-4o and ask specifically for it
10) I was not able to access to the images that had been generated, so I had to ask "No se puede acceder a este sitio web", so it replied that I had to generate it via Lucidchart or draw.io
11) I request it in lucidchart
12) Again in ChatGPT: please with the provided information create the C4 diagram with the following parts:
    **Prompt C4 diagram - 1**:
    list me all the existing existing containers in a bullet list with only the names of the containers.

**Prompt C4 diagram - 2**:
Now I want you to list me all the componenst in a bullet list of the job service container

**Prompt C4 diagram - 3**:
Now I want you to list me all the componenst in a bullet list of the job service container

**Prompt C4 diagram - 4**:
I want you to generate a UML code to create a multi-level c4 diagram for the container Job Service and its component Job posting Service
13) i need a graphic version of the whole C4 with its 4 parts
14) separate each part and show them as a waterfall
15) many words are blurry, and it is not presented as a waterfall
16) It informed me that I could use PlantUML to generate the graphic diagram from the provided UML, and I asked it to generate the PNG image
17) ChatGPT in not able to generate the image, so I have only added the previous C4 informed diagram
