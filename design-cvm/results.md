## 2. Key Use Cases

### Use Case 1: AI-Assisted Candidate Screening
```plantuml
@startuml
actor "HR Manager" as HR
participant "ATS System" as ATS
participant "AI Engine" as AI
database "Candidate DB" as DB

HR -> ATS: Upload job description
ATS -> AI: Process requirements
AI -> DB: Match candidates
DB --> AI: Candidate profiles
AI --> ATS: Ranked matches
ATS --> HR: Candidate shortlist
HR -> ATS: Review candidates
ATS -> DB: Update status
@enduml
```

### Use Case 2: Technical Assessment Flow
```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Candidate" as C
actor "Evaluator" as E
participant "Assessment Platform" as AP
participant "AI Analyzer" as AI

C -> AP: Start assessment
AP -> C: Present challenges
C -> AP: Submit solutions
AP -> AI: Analyze submission
AI --> AP: Technical score
AP -> E: Notify completion
E -> AP: Review results
AP -> C: Send feedback
@enduml
```

### Use Case 3: Collaborative Evaluation
```plantuml
@startuml
actor "HR" as HR
actor "Technical Lead" as TL
actor "Department Manager" as DM
participant "ATS" as ATS
database "Evaluation DB" as DB

HR -> ATS: Initialize evaluation
ATS -> TL: Request technical review
ATS -> DM: Request team fit review
TL --> ATS: Submit tech evaluation
DM --> ATS: Submit team evaluation
ATS -> DB: Aggregate feedback
DB --> ATS: Generate summary
ATS --> HR: Present decision support
@enduml
```

## 3. Data Model

### Entities
1. **Candidate**
   - Core entity representing job applicants
   - Stores professional and contact information
   
2. **Position**
   - Represents job openings
   - Contains requirements and position details

3. **Assessment**
   - Technical and soft skills evaluations
   - Includes different types of assessments

4. **Interview**
   - Scheduling and feedback for interview sessions
   - Tracks multiple rounds of interviews

5. **Evaluation**
   - Collaborative feedback and scoring
   - Aggregates multiple evaluator inputs

### Entity Relationships
```plantuml
@startuml
!define ENTITY class

ENTITY Candidate {
  +id: UUID
  +name: String
  +email: String
  +skills: String[]
  +experience: Integer
  +status: Status
}

ENTITY Position {
  +id: UUID
  +title: String
  +department: String
  +requirements: String[]
  +status: Status
}

ENTITY Assessment {
  +id: UUID
  +type: AssessmentType
  +score: Float
  +feedback: String
  +date: DateTime
}

ENTITY Interview {
  +id: UUID
  +datetime: DateTime
  +type: InterviewType
  +status: Status
  +feedback: String
}

ENTITY Evaluation {
  +id: UUID
  +score: Float
  +comments: String
  +decision: Decision
  +date: DateTime
}

Candidate "1" -- "many" Position : applies to
Position "1" -- "many" Assessment : requires
Candidate "1" -- "many" Assessment : takes
Candidate "1" -- "many" Interview : participates
Interview "1" -- "many" Evaluation : generates

## 4. System Design (High Level)

### Global Description
The LTI ATS is designed as a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. It uses event-driven communication for real-time updates and follows domain-driven design principles. The system is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, enabling cloud-native deployment and scaling.

### System Architecture
```plantuml
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Container>

System_Boundary(ats, "LTI ATS") {
    Container(web, "Web Application", "React", "User interface")
    Container(api, "API Gateway", "Node.js", "API management")
    Container(auth, "Auth Service", "Go", "Authentication")
    Container(candidate, "Candidate Service", "Java", "Candidate management")
    Container(assessment, "Assessment Service", "Python", "Technical evaluations")
    Container(matching, "AI Matching Engine", "Python", "ML-based matching")
    ContainerDb(db, "Main Database", "PostgreSQL", "Data storage")
    ContainerDb(cache, "Cache", "Redis", "Performance cache")
}

System_Ext(email, "Email Service")
System_Ext(calendar, "Calendar Service")

Rel(web, api, "Uses", "HTTPS")
Rel(api, auth, "Authenticates")
Rel(api, candidate, "Manages candidates")
Rel(api, assessment, "Handles assessments")
Rel(candidate, matching, "Requests matches")
Rel_R(matching, db, "Reads/Writes")
Rel_L(assessment, cache, "Caches results")
@enduml
```

## 5. C4 Detailed Diagram - AI Matching Engine

I'll focus on the AI Matching Engine as it's a critical component that differentiates LTI's ATS in the market.

### Component Justification
The AI Matching Engine is crucial because it:
- Reduces time-to-hire by automatically identifying suitable candidates
- Improves match quality through machine learning algorithms
- Provides data-driven insights for better hiring decisions
- Scales efficiently with increasing job positions and candidates

### Context Level
```plantuml
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Context>

Person(recruiter, "HR Recruiter", "Uses system to find candidates")
Person(candidate, "Job Candidate", "Applies for positions")

System(ats, "LTI ATS", "Applicant Tracking System")
System_Ext(linkedin, "LinkedIn", "Professional network")
System_Ext(github, "GitHub", "Code repository")

Rel(recruiter, ats, "Posts jobs and reviews matches")
Rel(candidate, ats, "Submits application")
Rel(ats, linkedin, "Fetches profiles")
Rel(ats, github, "Analyzes repositories")
@enduml
```

### Container Level
```plantuml
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Container>

Container_Boundary(matching, "AI Matching Engine") {
    Container(api, "Matching API", "Python/FastAPI", "Handles matching requests")
    Container(processor, "Data Processor", "Python", "Processes candidate data")
    Container(ml, "ML Engine", "Python/TensorFlow", "Executes matching algorithms")
    Container(analyzer, "Skills Analyzer", "Python/NLTK", "Analyzes skills and experience")
    ContainerDb(model_db, "Model Storage", "MLflow", "Stores ML models")
    ContainerDb(vector_db, "Vector Database", "Pinecone", "Stores embeddings")
}

System_Ext(candidate_svc, "Candidate Service")
System_Ext(position_svc, "Position Service")

Rel(candidate_svc, api, "Sends candidate data")
Rel(position_svc, api, "Sends job requirements")
Rel(api, processor, "Routes requests")
Rel(processor, ml, "Requests matching")
Rel(ml, analyzer, "Analyzes content")
Rel(ml, model_db, "Uses models")
Rel(ml, vector_db, "Queries vectors")
@enduml
```

### Component Level
```plantuml
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Component>

Container_Boundary(ml, "ML Engine") {
    Component(matcher, "Matcher", "Python", "Executes matching logic")
    Component(ranker, "Ranker", "Python", "Ranks candidates")
    Component(scorer, "Scorer", "Python", "Calculates match scores")
    Component(explainer, "Explainer", "Python", "Generates explanations")
    Component(validator, "Validator", "Python", "Validates results")
    
    Rel(matcher, ranker, "Sends matches")
    Rel(ranker, scorer, "Requests scores")
    Rel(scorer, explainer, "Requests explanations")
    Rel(explainer, validator, "Validates output")
}

ContainerDb(cache, "Redis Cache")
ContainerDb(vector_store, "Vector Store")

Rel(matcher, cache, "Caches results")
Rel(matcher, vector_store, "Queries embeddings")
@enduml
```

### Code Level (Optional)
```python:/Users/cristian/LIDR-AI4Devs/AI4Devs-design-1/src/matching/matcher.py
class SkillMatcher:
    def __init__(self, model_provider: ModelProvider, cache: Cache):
        self.model = model_provider.get_current_model()
        self.cache = cache
        self.validator = MatchValidator()
    
    async def find_matches(
        self, 
        position_id: str, 
        candidates: List[Candidate]
    ) -> List[Match]:
        # Get position requirements
        requirements = await self.get_position_requirements(position_id)
        
        # Generate embeddings
        requirement_vector = self.model.encode(requirements)
        
        # Find matches
        matches = []
        for candidate in candidates:
            score = await self.calculate_match_score(
                candidate, 
                requirement_vector
            )
            if self.validator.is_valid_match(score):
                matches.append(Match(candidate, score))
        
        return sorted(matches, key=lambda m: m.score, reverse=True)
```

This completes the detailed C4 model for the AI Matching Engine component, showing how it integrates with the rest of the system and handles the critical task of matching candidates to positions.
