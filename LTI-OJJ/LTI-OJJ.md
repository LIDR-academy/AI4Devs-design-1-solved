### Added Value

LTI transforms the traditional recruitment process into an efficient, data-driven workflow that:

- Reduces hiring time by 40% through automation of repetitive tasks
- Improves hiring quality through a structured evaluation process
- Provides real-time analytics on recruitment performance
- Integrates all stages of the process in a single platform, eliminating the need for multiple tools

### Competitive Advantages

- Complete hiring cycle management: Unlike fragmented solutions, LTI covers the entire process from posting to hiring.
- Advanced technical assessment system: Integrated platform to design, administer, and evaluate customized technical tests based on the position.
- Automated multichannel distribution: Synchronized publishing across multiple job boards and social networks with a single click.
- Predictive candidate analytics: Algorithms that evaluate candidate suitability based on predefined criteria and past experiences.
- Customizable and adaptable interface: Adjusts to the specific workflows of each organization.

### Main Benefits

1. Intelligent Automation

2. Enhanced Candidate Experience
   - Customizable candidate portal offering transparent communication, timely feedback, and a simplified application process, improving employer brand image.
3. Data-Driven Decision Making
   - Analytical dashboard providing key metrics such as time-to-hire, most effective candidate sources, and conversion rates by stage of the process.
4. Advanced Technical Assessment Management
   - Integrated system for creating customized technical evaluations, monitoring their completion in real-time, and automatically analyzing results.
5. Scalability and Flexibility
   - Designed to adapt to both small businesses and large corporations, allowing scalability according to hiring needs.

# 3 Main Use Cases for the LTI System

## Use Case 1: Job Posting and Candidate Management

### Description

This use case covers the complete process from creating a job offer to receiving and initially filtering candidates. The recruiter creates a new job posting in the system, configures the requirements and job description, selects publication channels, and the system automatically distributes the offer. As candidates apply, the system collects their data, generates evaluable profiles, and allows the recruiter to perform initial filtering based on predefined criteria.

## Use Case 2: Technical Assessment Management

### Description

This use case focuses on the technical evaluation process for candidates. The recruiter selects candidates for assessment, configures or selects an appropriate technical test from the system library, and sends invitations. Candidates access the integrated testing platform, complete the assessments, and the system automatically analyzes the results. The system provides performance metrics and comparisons, allowing the recruiter to make informed decisions about which candidates will advance to the interview phase.

## Use Case 3: Interview Management and Hiring

### Description

This use case covers the final phase of the recruitment process, from scheduling interviews to formalizing the hire. The recruiter schedules interviews with selected candidates, the system automatically coordinates availability between interviewers and candidates, and sends reminders. After interviews, evaluators record feedback in the system, which consolidates all assessments. The recruiter can then select the final candidate, initiate the offer process, negotiate terms through the system, and formalize the hire, automatically generating the necessary documentation.

These three use cases represent the complete workflow in the LTI system, from posting the job offer to the final hiring of the candidate. Each diagram illustrates the actors involved and the sequential interactions that occur during each phase of the recruitment process.

- An **APPLICATION** links a **CANDIDATE** to a specific **JOB_POSTING** and may require **ASSESSMENTS** and **INTERVIEWS**
- **ASSESSMENT_TEMPLATES** are reused across different **JOB_POSTINGS**
- A successful **APPLICATION** concludes with an **OFFER**
- **NOTIFICATIONS** are generated by various entities and sent to **USERS** and **CANDIDATES**

This data model provides a solid foundation for the LTI system, supporting all three main use cases described earlier while maintaining proper data relationships and integrity.

# High-Level System Design for LTI

## System Architecture Overview

The LTI Talent Acquisition Management System is designed as a modern, scalable application following a microservices architecture. This approach allows for independent scaling of different components based on demand while maintaining high availability and reliability. Below is a high-level explanation of the system architecture.
