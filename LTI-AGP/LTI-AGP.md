# HireSphere - Developing an ATS Tracking system

## Introduction

### What is an ATS?

An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is a software solution designed to streamline and automate the hiring process. It enables organizations to manage the entire lifecycle of a job position, from creation and publication to applicant tracking and final hiring decisions. By leveraging technology, ATS platforms reduce manual workload, improve efficiency, and enhance candidate experience.

Modern ATS platforms integrate AI-driven functionalities, such as resume parsing, automated interview scheduling, and predictive analytics, to help HR teams make informed decisions faster. These systems are widely used by enterprises, staffing agencies, and recruitment firms to optimize hiring workflows, ensuring a seamless experience for both recruiters and candidates.

### Why Build a Next-Gen ATS?

The hiring landscape is evolving rapidly, with increased demand for AI-driven insights, automation, and data-driven decision-making. Many existing ATS solutions lack the agility to incorporate real-time AI advancements or provide a truly seamless and intuitive user experience.

Our goal is to build an ATS that:

- **Enhances Efficiency**: Reduces manual effort by automating repetitive tasks.

- **Improves Candidate Experience**: Provides a streamlined and personalized application process.

- **Empowers Recruiters**: Uses AI-powered insights to identify top talent quickly.

- **Integrates with the Modern Tech Stack**: Seamlessly connects with LinkedIn, Slack, Google Calendar, and HR tools.

- **Adapts to the Future of Work**: Supports remote and hybrid hiring, asynchronous interviews, and data-driven hiring strategies.

By leveraging AI, automation, and a user-centric design, we aim to redefine how organizations manage talent acquisition.

## System Design

### High Level system design

Our ATS system follows an Event-Driven Microservices Architecture using an API Gateway to route requests and enforce security.
 ‚Ä¢ Users (Recruiters & Applicants) interact with the Web Application.
 ‚Ä¢ API Gateway handles authentication, authorization, and event publishing before forwarding requests to services.
 ‚Ä¢ Microservices handle specific functionalities:
 ‚Ä¢ Auth Service: Manages authentication & user roles.
 ‚Ä¢ Applicant/Candidate Service: Stores candidate profiles & applications.
 ‚Ä¢ Scheduler Service: Handles interview scheduling & calendar integration.
 ‚Ä¢ Job Service: Manages job postings & workflows.
 ‚Ä¢ OpenCATS Service: Acts as the primary ATS data provider.
 ‚Ä¢ Event Bus (EventBridge + SQS) captures all system events for real-time processing.

üõ† System Flow

 1. User accesses the Web Application ‚Üí Authenticated via the Auth Service.
 2. Web App sends requests to API Gateway:
 ‚Ä¢ API Gateway validates authentication & permissions.
 ‚Ä¢ API Gateway publishes an event before forwarding the request.
 3. Requests are routed to microservices:
 ‚Ä¢ Job postings ‚Üí Job Service (which updates OpenCATS).
 ‚Ä¢ Candidate applications ‚Üí Applicant Service.
 ‚Ä¢ Scheduling interviews ‚Üí Scheduler Service.
 4. OpenCATS Service acts as the main data source, queried by other services as needed.
 5. All updates trigger an event ‚Üí Used for notifications, analytics, or async processing.

‚úÖ **Saves development time** by leveraging existing ATS functionalities.  
‚úÖ **Open-source & extensible**, reducing vendor lock-in.  
‚úÖ **Supports API-based integrations**, making it compatible with our architecture.  
‚úÖ **Used by SMEs**, aligning with our market focus.  

#### **ADR-002 Consequences**

- We must **extend OpenCATS APIs** for job posting automation.  
- Requires **additional security layers** for **GDPR compliance**.  

---

### **ADR-003: Architecture & Integration Paradigm**

#### **ADR-003 Context**

Our ATS system must support:

- **Custom AI-driven features** (AI resume matching, job description generator, interview scheduling)
- **Core ATS functionality from OpenCATS**
- **Scalability & flexibility for future integrations**

#### **ADR-003 Decision**

We will use an **Event-Driven Microservices Architecture** with an **API Gateway** to integrate with OpenCATS.

#### **ADR-003 Rationale**

‚úÖ **Modular & Scalable:** Microservices allow independent feature scaling.  
‚úÖ **Decoupling:** Custom ATS features run as separate services, reducing OpenCATS dependencies.  
‚úÖ **Asynchronous Processing:** Enables event-driven automation, like candidate ranking and interview scheduling.  
‚úÖ **API Gateway:** Unifies integrations, exposing **REST APIs** to external tools (JobHunt, Slack, HR platforms).  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Event Publishing:** ATS activities trigger events (e.g., "New Application Received" ‚Üí Notification Service).  

#### **ADR-003 Consequences**

- Requires **event queue management (e.g., Kafka, SQS)**.  
- OpenCATS will act as a **data provider**, not a direct API consumer.  
- We must ensure **security and authentication** for inter-service communications.  

### **ADR-004: API Definition Compatible with JobHunt**

#### **ADR-004 Context**

To ensure **wider job board compatibility**, our ATS needs **a standard API** that aligns with **JobHunt** specifications.

#### **ADR-004 Decision**

We will build an API **compatible with JobHunt** to allow seamless job posting.

#### **ADR-004 Rationale**

‚úÖ **Instant integration** with job boards and external recruitment tools.  
‚úÖ **Standardized data structure**, improving interoperability.  
‚úÖ **Simplifies expansion**, reducing custom API needs for third-party integrations.  

#### **ADR-004 Consequences**

#### **ADR-006 Rationale**

‚úÖ Decoupling: Services can operate independently, reducing dependencies.
‚úÖ Scalability: Allows processing large volumes of events asynchronously.
‚úÖ Reliability: DLQ ensures failed messages are retried or logged for debugging.
‚úÖ Real-Time Processing: Enables instant notifications and service updates (e.g., job applications, interview scheduling).
‚úÖ Fanout Pattern: One event can trigger multiple services (e.g., "New Application Received" ‚Üí triggers OpenCATS update, recruiter notification, and analytics logging).

#### **ADR-006 Consequences**

Increased complexity: Requires event schema definitions and error handling strategies.

Monitoring overhead: Needs observability tools to track failed messages and processing times.
  
##**LTI Exercise Conclusions**

### Time used

It took me around 4 hours to finish the excercies

- 1 hour to plan exactly the process i want to follow
- 2,5 hours to execute all the process
- 0,5 hours to format and generate the final output

### Doubts and reflections

- There was some time consumed mainly:
  - Moving information between tools
  - Adjusting responses and outputs from LLMs
  - Adjusting formatting (even some of it it si still not correct like the swot analysis)
- I would like to generate partial documentation of a psecific project on a CI/CD project.
- With a new blank project it is easier to implment than in an existing project
- I would like to use a specific documentation page or tool, and a hierachy
- The script process should find automatically new patterns, and modify the documentation, for example create new DAR
