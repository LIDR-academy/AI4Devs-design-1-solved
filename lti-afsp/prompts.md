# Prompts Used for LTI ATS Design

## Research and Analysis

### Investigating Current ATS Market
```
What are the most significant pain points in current Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that frustrate HR departments, hiring managers, and candidates? Identify key opportunities for innovation.
```

### Competitive Differentiation
```
What innovative features could make a new Applicant Tracking System stand out in today's market? Focus on AI capabilities, collaboration tools, and candidate experience.
```

### AI Applications in Recruitment
```
How can artificial intelligence transform the recruitment process beyond basic automation? Include specific examples of advanced AI applications that provide measurable benefits to both recruiters and candidates.
```

## Product Description and Business Model

### Value Proposition Development
```
Create a compelling value proposition for a next-generation ATS platform focused on enhancing efficiency, improving quality-of-hire, and streamlining collaboration between HR teams and hiring managers.
```

### Lean Canvas Model
```
Design a Lean Canvas business model for an AI-powered Applicant Tracking System targeting mid-sized enterprises and high-growth companies. Include problem statements, unique value proposition, unfair advantages, customer segments, key metrics, channels, cost structure, and revenue streams.
```

## Use Case Development

### End-to-End Candidate Journey
```
Design a detailed use case diagram and flow for the end-to-end candidate journey in an advanced ATS, from application to onboarding. Include all key actors, main flow steps, and explain how AI enhances each step.
```

### Collaborative Hiring Workflow
```
Create a comprehensive use case for collaborative hiring in an ATS, focusing on how multiple stakeholders (recruiters, hiring managers, interview team) interact with the system to evaluate candidates and make hiring decisions.
```

### AI-Powered Candidate Matching
```
Design a detailed use case for an AI-powered candidate matching and screening system. Include how the system analyzes job requirements, evaluates candidates, and provides intelligent recommendations to recruiters.
```

## Data Modeling

### Core Entity Identification
```
Identify the core entities needed for a comprehensive ATS data model, including their primary attributes (with data types) and relationships. Focus on supporting the key use cases of candidate management, job management, application tracking, and collaborative evaluation.
```

### Data Model Design
```
Create a detailed entity-relationship diagram for an ATS with emphasis on candidate tracking, job management, and evaluation workflows. Include all important attributes for each entity with appropriate data types and all relationships between entities.
```

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
```
Design a high-level system architecture diagram for a modern cloud-based ATS. Include all key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other. The architecture should support the key features of AI-powered matching, collaborative workflows, and real-time analytics.
```

### Technology Stack Recommendations
```
Recommend a modern technology stack for building a scalable, cloud-native ATS platform with AI capabilities. Include specific technologies for frontend, backend, databases, search, caching, AI/ML services, and integration layers.
```

## C4 Model Development

### C4 Context and Container Diagrams
```
Create C4 context and container diagrams for the AI Matching Engine component of an ATS platform. The diagrams should show how this component fits into the overall system and its major subcomponents.
```

### C4 Component Diagrams
```
Develop detailed C4 component diagrams for the key parts of the AI Matching Engine: Matching API, Profile Analyzer, Learning Engine, and Matching Rules Engine. Include the responsibilities of each component and their interactions.
```

### Matching Algorithm Pseudocode
```
Write pseudocode for the core candidate-to-job matching algorithm that would be implemented in the AI Matching Engine. Include how it would handle skills matching, experience evaluation, and custom matching rules.
```
